        </div> 
    
        <div class="right-text-item">
            <p>Over the last 2 years, I have indulged in working as a Web Developer (C#, ASP.Net Core, Entity 
                Framework, SQL Server) working on application tickets. Prior to that, I have many years 
                working on Windows Desktop applications (Winforms) C# and VB.NET. Throughout my career, 
                I have worked in teams as well as on solo projects covering all the stages of the software 
                development life cycle. My next step is to up-skill in web technologies. I have recently been 
                upskilling myself in ASP.NET Core V7.
                <br><br>
                I'm currently studying a 3/4 month edX Front End BootCamp course which covers HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and WebAPI.    
                <br><br>
                I have excellent communication skills and open to working as a Web Developer, Winforms 
                Developer, SQL Developer, Product Owner, Scrum Master, or Applications/Software Trainer.
